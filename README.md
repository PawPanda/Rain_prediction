# Rain_prediction
This project is a part of IBM Machine Learning for Python. In this, I have used multiple classification algorithms- Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Linear Regression.  To classify and predict the rain in Australia. Also, used multiple metrics- Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1- score, Log loss, etc. for model evaluation
